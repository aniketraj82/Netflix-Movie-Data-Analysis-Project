# Netflix-Movie-Data-Analysis-Project

Overview

This project was built to explore, analyze, and extract insights from data using Python.

The main objective is to:

Load and clean raw data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Apply statistical or computational methods

Visualize results clearly

Draw meaningful conclusions

The entire workflow is implemented inside a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and step-by-step explanation.

Problem Statement

Many real-world datasets contain inconsistencies, missing values, and unstructured information. Extracting useful insights from such data requires:

Proper data preprocessing

Systematic analysis

Clear visualization

Logical interpretation

This project addresses these challenges by building a structured and reproducible analysis pipeline.

Solution Approach

The solution follows these main steps:

Data Loading
Import datasets using Pandas.

Data Cleaning
Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis
